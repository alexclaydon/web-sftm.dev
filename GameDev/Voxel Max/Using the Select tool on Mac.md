Pending beta updates to the operation of `Select All`.

%%using `Select - Expand` results in a UX that is somewhat inconsistent with the UX conventions of MacOS
better to stick to using the `Select - New` tool then just hit the `Shift` modifier when you need multiple objects

So this is sort of Mac feedback, but might also be relevant to iOS. Also, it might be highly subjective - I've no idea if anyone else feels this way (love to hear either way!):

Probably the only part of the Mac interface that still trips me up even a couple of months into using VM, is wanting a fast way to de-select all objects when you're using `Select - Expand` tool.

When you're in `Select - New`, clicking anywhere in the viewport or outliner other than on an object will deselect all objects. But in `Select - Expand`, you can't de-select like that. I sort of get why it works like that, but also feel that for consistency it would be better if both `New` and `Expand` allowed de-selection of all objects by clicking anywhere in the viewport or outliner that isn't on an object.
On the other hand, I imagine that one problem with this is that on iOS perhaps you are much more likely to accidentally de-select if it worked this way (I'm not sure - I've been using Mac much more than iOS recently). In which case if you changed only how the Mac worked, but not iOS, perhaps that would result in an undesirable inconsistency - I'm not sure, perhaps it wouldn't; perhaps this is in the nature of a difference that makes both platforms better without confusing users. In any event, if the imperative if consistency, perhaps an alternative to "left-click anywhere" on the Mac would be a keyboard shortcut for `Select - Deselect All`? At present as far as I can tell, the only way to use this is to long press on the `Select` tool and select it directly from the pop-up menu.

At the moment I'm finding that I'm just avoiding `Select - Expand` altogether because the UX on Mac of using `Select - New` plus the `Shift` key feels much more natural.

CMD + A is a toggle - will deselect all%%
