## Pivot

The `Pivot` section of the `Object Properties` panel allows you to control the in-scene pivoting behaviour of any object.

After selecting an axis (X, Y, Z) and a face (or the object centre) along that axis (-, O, +), you can control the location of the pivot point on that face using the 9 control points arranged in a 3 x 3 grid.

Note that while this provides fine-grained control, it does not permit arbitrary placement - you'll still need to make do with that 3 x 3 grid.  In addition, you can't at present set an arbitrary pivot point outside of the object to act as a pivot point.
