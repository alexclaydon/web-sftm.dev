As your projects grow larger and more complex, you might like to use some of your completed models as the basis for an asset library.

Go to the Asset Browser (outliner), hit the three dot menu, then `Import`.  This will open a library of in-built assets.  To add the contents of one of your own .vmax files, click this button:

![[Publish/zImages/vm-import-button.png]]

Select the file, and you're done.  Note that in order for an object to correctly appear in the `Import` tab, it must be either a top level group or object.  The imported assets will persist across new projects, so you don't need to re-import for each new project.

Easy as that.
