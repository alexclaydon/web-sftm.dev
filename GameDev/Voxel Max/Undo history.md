Voxel Max retains separate undo histories for the scene as a whole, and each object in it.  This allows you to go into an object and undo / redo) changes to it without undoing / redoing changes to the scene as a whole.

It also means that if you're at scene level, hitting undo / redo and not seeing the changes you expect to a given object, you can fix that by going into edit mode on that object first.
