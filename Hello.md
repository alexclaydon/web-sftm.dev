This site is a companion to the [Stories from the Machine](https://www.youtube.com/@machine_stories) channel.

Along with transcripts of the videos on that channel (as well as of game reviews that haven't yet been made into videos), I also write about using Unreal Engine 5, Blender and Voxel Max together in a gamedev pipeline.

You can navigate this site using the folder tree or search box at left, or in-page links.
